		<div class="box fade-in one"><p><h4>Hello, I am Suresh from New York. Recently, I graduated with my undergrad degree in information system management and found similar program here at Harvard for master degree. For past few years, I have taken the role of a management consultant to assist enterprises with their complex business problem and to design logical solutions. Beside academia and professional life, I enjoy reading, philosophy and anything to do with consciousness.</p>

		<p>Throughout, my research I came across many posting referring the use of a Sublime text editor. Since I am a newbie in the domain of development, I choose to go with Sublime text editor and so far I like it. It is better than notepad, at least I think; you might be disagreed with me.</p><h4></div>
